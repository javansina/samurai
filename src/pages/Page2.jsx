                     blade: Traditionally made from high-carbon steel using a
                     process called &quot;Tamahagane.&quot; The steel is
                     repeatedly folded and forged to create a strong, sharp
                     blade with a distinct grain pattern known as
                     &quot;Hamon.&quot;

                     cord (Ito). The handle fittings, such as the guard (Tsuba),

                     intricately decorated.

                        (1185-1333) in Japan. It was developed to suit the needs
                        of Samurai warriors, particularly for use in battle.

                        (1336-1573), the design of the Katana became more
                        refined, emphasizing balance and cutting efficiency.
